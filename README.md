(the website the link direct to is written in Dutch)

This project aims to give better insights to the fertility of the soil
by measuring properties like temperature, moisture, luminosity and mineral concentrations.

By logging the values of these properties, it will develop a model over time which provides the product owner with valuable information on keeping their soil healthy and fertile.
